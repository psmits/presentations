Timestamp	What year are you?	What pets DO YOU HAVE RIGHT NOW? This is the extant question.	What pets HAVE YOU HAD in the past? This is the extirpated question. Sorry for your loss.	In a perfect world what pets do you WANT? This is the expected question. Don't let 'laws' or 'practicality' constrain you.	If you have a cat is it from Hyde Park Cats?	Comments? Care to explain why you want 20 parakeets? Hmmmm?

I told him to just get rid of it, but he proclaimed that it was too cute to kill (it was). He set up a large rubbermaid bin as its home, named it Sweet Pea, and kept it as a pet for one week, when it promptly escaped back into our kitchen.   Due to some fish tank drama (one cichlid trying to eat another cichlid) we moved some fish around to a new tank and got a "friend" for the unfortunate cichlid victim. The friend soon turned into a lover and many cichlid babies were born shortly after. We now have about 50 adult cichlids crammed into two tanks and are trying to figure out what to do with them. Anyone want a cichlid or two? Contact Kate.

That's the dream.  I also want a small tank full of the weirdest looking sea slugs. Because sea slugs are crazy and adorable.

In particular, I say we had a frog, but it was a mail-order tadpole that took 10 months to grow legs, but never got bigger. It then lost function in the left side of its body and swam in circles for two weeks.   The crow was a juvenile that had been attacked by something - a dog or some magpies, and was missing some key feathers from it's back end and wing. My sister captured it in the park near our house, carried it home wrapped in a jacket (much to its parents dismay) and fenced it in the side yard. She fed it eggs and noodles and fruits and other leftovers for about a month until it flew away. Its name was Sanchez. She also captured an orange cat in a similar fashion once, but had to give him back to the owner later that evening, even though she had already renamed him Cheddar.   Sheba was a black cat who adopted my family when I was really little. My dad wanted nothing to do with a cat. However, she was ridiculously competent at catching gophers, who had recently destroyed my dad's beautiful new English garden. Think plants disappearing into the ground, Bugs Bunny style. Around Christmas, my mom took one of the "presents" and wrapped it up in a pretty little green striped box with a tag that said "TO EVAN LOVE THE CAT" and left it on the front porch. My dad wasn't amused, but this was the funniest thing in the world to 4-year old Amy.   I had a hermit crab named Maurice Escargot who escaped his tank so often that we painted his shell with pink nail polish so we could find him more easily. We once caught him making his way down the driveway.

I believe this was prompted by my recent attempt to keep toads hidden in my room in an old shoebox. Better to keep any new pets where they could see them – plus, the aquarium had a lid. It was by far the best day of young life. We went to Jack's Aquarium and I lovingly selected colorful gravel, rocks, decorations, and after careful consideration, I brought home an aquatic newt, a small catfish, and a tiny frog.  For context, this was just two short months after the iconic "Ask Jeeves" search engine was created. Google was still years away. It was a different time... a time when you simply put your faith in the assurances of random teenaged pet store employees. We were promised that the three little critters would live in harmony together for the next 2-3 years (a veritable lifetime, to a 7-year-old).   The newt and the catfish kept their end of the bargain, and were adequate if slightly boring pets who crossed the rainbow bridge to the toilet bowl after a few years.   The frog grew. And then grew claws. And he used those claws to tear up plants, his aquarium companions, and essentially any food or non-food item within his reach, including the bullfrog tadpole that I proudly presented to him as a new friend. Long after the other aquarium inhabitants -- who eventually had to be housed in their own, murder-free tank -- were just distant memories, the frog lived on, making occasional bids for freedom that were never quite successful, and spending his nights singing me the song of his people.  On my 17th birthday, I finally Googled "how long do aquatic frogs live?" and discovered that I had a Xenopus. And that at the tender age of 7, I had made what could be up to a 30 year commitment to his care.  He still lives in my childhood bedroom, where he is fed regularly by my long-suffering, squeamish mother, who has never quite forgiven me. He'll be 20 next summer. Just one more decade to go.

A couple of years later my family and I had to move overseas. My mom put Pancha in a diaper (my brother was an infant) in her pocket for the move. We departed successfully but when trying to depart from our layover the authorities detected what they thought was an explosive in my mom's pocket. She was almost arrested and we avoided a large fine because it was apparent from my crying that Pancha was our pet and we weren't part of a smuggling ring. Pancha was confiscated by the authorities, and a few months later we received an official letter explaining that she had been placed in a zoo or sanctuary and that we could never see her again.
