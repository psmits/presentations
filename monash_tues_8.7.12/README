Data analyzed in this talk are from the pantheria database along with the paleobiology database. They are used here for illustrative and scientific purposes.

Pictures are marked with latex comments as to there source in almost all cases. They are used here for illustrative and fair use purposes, not as any sort of infringement.

This was a fun talk to give and I enjoyed myself.

In case it wasn't clear, this presentation is meant to in NO WAY mock Alroy.
